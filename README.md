# Workout App

This is an app for created for those who like to keep track of their core workouts, as well as add new workouts to the routine! It is a single page React application where i applied my knowledge of:
* Components, props and data flow
* State management
* Client-side routing using React Router
* Using json-server and making GET and POST requests
* CSS styling

# Description

* When you open up an app, you will see a home page with the name of the app, inspirational quote and a cute image of a cat working out
* This app will have clickable links on top of the page which will take you to either see a list of workouts or allow you to add a workout of your own using a state controlled form
* Once you add your custom workout you will be bale to see it added to the list of workouts
